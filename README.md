### 3D definitions
mesh: object made of polygons (people model with meshes not surfaces)
surfaces: math representation of a shape 

### Blender basic commands 
- Switch between vertices, edges and faces: 1,2,3
- padding: shift + middle mouse
- edit mode: tab (see polygons)
- add objects menu: shift + a
- subdivision surface: right click, modifier tab, subdivision surface increase in viewport or render (gives higher polymesh) Alternatively: Cntrl + number in the number row to subdivide the object.
